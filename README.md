# V8.Net
.NET wrapper for Google V8 JavaScript engine.

The project is based on the Javascript.Net project and is intended to improve on the previous project's shortcomings.

#Getting Started
The project is supposed to be more or less self contained. However you may choose to which V8 engine version you want to use. The default value is the current stable branch given at http://omahaproxy.appspot.com/ .
It is strongly suggested that when you build and consume the library, you should use the latest stable window branch from the chromiom projects.

##Requirements
	- Visual Studio >= 2010
	- Powershell (Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned)

#Building from Source
